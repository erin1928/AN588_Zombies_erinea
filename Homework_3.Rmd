```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r import csv, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
zombie_data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/zombies.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Problem 1: Means
```{r read csv, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
zombie_data
height <- zombie_data[["height"]]
weight <- zombie_data[["weight"]]
killed <- zombie_data[["zombies_killed"]]
age <- zombie_data[["age"]]
years_of_education <- zombie_data[["years_of_education"]]
mean_height <- mean(height)
mean_height
mean_weight <- mean(weight)
mean_weight
mean_age <- mean(age)
mean_age
mean_killed <- mean(killed)
mean(killed)
mean_years_of_education <- mean(years_of_education)
mean_years_of_education
```

## Problem 1: Standard Deviations
```{r boxplot of age, include=TRUE}
sum_squared_diff_age <- sum((age - mean_age)^2)
population_sd_age <- sqrt(sum_squared_diff_age / length(age))
population_sd_age
sum_squared_diff_weight <- sum((weight - mean_weight)^2)
population_sd_weight <- sqrt(sum_squared_diff_weight / length(weight))
population_sd_weight
sum_squared_diff_height <- sum((height - mean_height)^2)
population_sd_height <- sqrt(sum_squared_diff_height / length(height))
population_sd_height
sum_squared_diff_killed <- sum((killed - mean_killed)^2)
population_sd_killed <- sqrt(sum_squared_diff_killed / length(killed))
population_sd_killed
sum_squared_diff_years <- sum((years_of_education - mean_years_of_education)^2)
population_sd_years <- sqrt(sum_squared_diff_years / length(years_of_education))
population_sd_years
```

## Problem 2: Age
```{r boxplot of age, include=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
box_plot <- ggplot(data = zombie_data, aes(x = gender, y = (age)))
box_plot <- box_plot + geom_boxplot()
box_plot <- box_plot + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
box_plot <- box_plot + ylab("Age") + xlab("Gender")
box_plot
```
